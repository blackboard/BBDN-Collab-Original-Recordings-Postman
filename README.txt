# Collaborate Original Recording Download Postman Collection

This Postman collection will help you download your Collaborate Original recordings. 

To use this collection, you must first import the json file. Once this is imported, you need to edit the collection to configure it for use. On the variables page, you will need to enter your username, password, and the email address you want to send the results to.

* **USERNAME**: This is the SOAP API username used in the integration tools
* **PASSWORD**: This is the SOAP API password used in the integration tools
* **EMAIL**: Email to which the notification will be sent when the recording metadata are ready. The email would contain a link to download the CSV file

Currently, we only provide this capability in the Australian data center. As we add more, this collection will be updated for those endpoints.
